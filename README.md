I am a Seneca College graduate who finished my Computer Programming & Analysis studies in 2022 with High Honours.

I have almost a year of experience working with ML and Big Data. Additionally, I worked as a Research Assistant maintaining Open-Source projects and administrating Linux platforms. Capable of building complex prediction models, responsive full-stack web applications and general software. I am interested in optimization and portability across platforms using Parallel algorithms, architecture-specific SIMD implementations and orchestration systems.
